                <p class="central-text">The most successful video games often get remade in order for modern audiences to get a chance at experiencing what they had to offer. This site aims to help people explore more about these remakes from an outside perspective.</p>
                <p class="central-text">Some remakes are considered to be better than their originals, while others end up being poorly received. There are multiple different factors that go into producing a well-liked remake, but ultimately, I think fans hope for remakes to deliver the same familiar feelings that caused them to fall in love with the originals in the first place.</p>
                <p class="central-text">With these things in mind, please feel free to browse around the different remakes showcased on this site. You may just discover a new game worth checking out!</p>
