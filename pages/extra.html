                <p class="central-text">Demon’s Souls is an action RPG developed by FromSoftware that is well known for innovating what is now an entire genre, “Soulslike” games, which are said to be some of the hardest action games out there. Early on in development, Demon’s Souls was a game that struggled with a lack of solid direction, which wasn’t aided by the fact that the game was considered quite difficult to play by newcomers. Despite this, the gameplay ended up being a massive hit in the gaming community which goes to show that taking risks in your gameplay ideas can definitely pay off.</p>
                <p class="central-text">In 2020, a Demon’s Souls remake hit the market and to no one’s surprise, the game sold extremely well at over 1.4 million copies by September 2021. Demon’s Souls proved multiple times that as long as your ideas are creative and your gameplay is fun, people will flock to a game that shows promise even in spite of rumoured unfair spikes in difficulty.</p>

                <p class="central-text">Shadow of the Colossus is a unique approach on the action-adventure genre which takes place in a fantasy world that inhabits massive beings known as colossi. In this world, the player is a mere human who traverses on foot and by horseback. The main drawing point of the game comes from the feeling of perseverance and triumph that the player is awarded with should they take down any of the massive colossi during their journey.</p>
                <p class="central-text">The distinctive gameplay that Shadow of the Colossus offers lead to the game being remade not only once, but twice! With both remakes being even better received than the last iteration of the game. There are not many other games out there that fulfill the same sense of adventure and accomplishment that Shadow of the Colossus does, and as a result, many players acknowledge this to be one of the best remakes of all time.</p>
