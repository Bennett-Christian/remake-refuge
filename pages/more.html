                <p class="central-text">The seventh installment in the Final Fantasy series is one of the most beloved by the community for a plethora of reasons. With fantastic commercial success and highly regarded gameplay, story and graphics for the time, Final Fantasy VII is considered by some to be one of the greatest video games ever made. This is why when Square wanted to remake Final Fantasy VII, they decided to split it up into a trilogy in order to allow themselves room to focus on all the juicy details.</p>
                <p class="central-text">The first part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake featured high-definition graphics suitable for its 2020 release which fans of the series immediately fell in love with. In addition to seeing their favourite characters in a much better light, the core gameplay was also enhanced but overall stayed true to Final Fantasy VII's roots. This is an example of a remake taking a chance at recreating the original atmosphere from the ground up and absolutely nailing it. Many fans are still enjoying Final Fantasy VII to this day as Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth just released this year in 2024.</p>

                <p class="central-text">Secret of Mana is another widely adored Square title that originally released in 1993. For how long ago it came out, many fans of the series believe that the core gameplay and atmosphere still hold up even by today's standards. This is largely thanks to the game's innovative real-time battle system, which really blows the RPG genre's turn-based competitors out of the water. Not to mention the outstanding soundtrack, that somehow sounded good even on the old-school Super Nintendo Entertainment System.</p>
                <p class="central-text">Unfortunately, the Secret of Mana remake failed to hit the mark, as they transformed the timeless pixel art into bland and lifeless 3D graphics with nothing remarkable about them. The remake also took away from some aspects of the adventure as there were multiple cutscenes that ended up being removed for seemingly no reason. Secret of Mana is the definition of a game that fans would've rather allowed to have been left untouched, as a disappointing remake is no fun for anybody.</p>
